Peer Review: Design wise, everything looks really clean and pleasing to see. It also helps you feel like your in the story. Story wise very well made and enjoyable. There is one problem, The buttons seem to not be fully functional meaning i have to click the text i cannot just click anywhere on the button. I love that there is a home button to go back to the main menu at any time. Other than that one problem job well done!
