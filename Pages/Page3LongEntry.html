<!--Page Three, Long Entry (Safe)
You decide to take the long but quiet route, if you were to be caught you would surely get killed or worse. As a benefit, 
the entry point is a lot closer. You head to the back alley, where you noticed a vent exit when you first scoped out the 
building.
Quickly you pull out your RC Vehicle, a silent spider looking device, and set it on the vent. It crawls in.
After a moment, you notice that there are two paths that you can take. One is a large vent shaft and the other is small.
